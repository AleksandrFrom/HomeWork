### Description of projects
Guess the hidden number by the computer in the minimum number of attempts

### What task is being solved
It is necessary to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Task conditions:** 
- The computer makes a number from 0 to 100.
It is necessary to guess this number. 
To do this, you need to write a program that will guess the hidden number in the minimum number of attempts.
- The algorithm takes into account a random number greater or less than our number.

### Metric
The result is estimated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions

### Result
The algorithm guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts - 7

## Conclusions
If the algorithm takes into account more or less of our number compared to a random one , then the number of attempts is significantly reduced.
